# Tajweed — A Quick Guide

## What is Tajweed?

Tajweed (تَجْوِيد) means **"to perfect, to beautify, or to improve."**

In Islamic practice, it is a set of rules that help readers recite the Quran in the same way that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ learned from Jibreel (AS).

---

## Why Learn Tajweed?

Tajweed ensures accurate recitation and prevents distortion of meaning. The rules:

- Differentiate between similar-sounding letters
- Regulate elongations that could otherwise alter word meanings
- Preserve the Quran as it was originally revealed

---

## Spiritual Benefits

The Prophet ﷺ said (narrated by A'ishah RA):

> *"One who recites the Quran smoothly will be in the company of noble, obedient angels. One who recites with difficulty, stuttering through it, will receive double the reward."*

Even beginners benefit spiritually from their sincere effort.

## How to Learn

Traditional instruction from a **qualified teacher** is strongly recommended, as self-assessment is difficult. Other approaches include:

- Recording your recitation and comparing with professional reciters
- Attending local mosque classes
- Enrolling in structured online courses
- Using YouTube resources alongside guided practice

## Core Tajweed Rules

### 1. Noon Sakinah (نْ) & Tanween (ـً ـٍ ـٌ)
Rules governing the 'nnn' sound when followed by specific letters. Has four sub-rules:

| Rule | Meaning | Condition |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Idhaar | Clear pronunciation | Noon followed by throat letters (ء هـ ع ح غ خ) |
| Idghaam | Merging/assimilation | Noon followed by merging letters |
| Iqlaab | Conversion | Noon followed by ب |
| Ikhfaa | Hiding/nasalization | Noon followed by remaining letters |

---

### 2. Idhaar (إِظْهَار) — Clear Pronunciation
Pronounce the noon clearly without ghunnah when followed by one of the **six throat letters**:

> ء  هـ  ع  ح  غ  خ

---

### 3. Idghaam (إِدْغَام) — Merging
Merge the noon into the following letter. Two types:

- **With Ghunnah (يرمنو)** — nasal sound is maintained during merge
- **Without Ghunnah (لر)** — noon merges completely with no nasalization

---

### 4. Iqlaab (إِقْلَاب) — Conversion
When noon sakinah or tanween is followed by **ب**, the noon converts into a **meem** sound with ghunnah applied.

---

### 5. Ikhfaa (إِخْفَاء) — Hiding
When noon sakinah or tanween is followed by the remaining 15 letters, the noon is **hidden** (not fully pronounced, not fully merged) while ghunnah is applied for two beats.

---

### 6. Noon & Meem Mushaddad (نّ / مّ)
When noon or meem carries a **shaddah (ّ)**, a **two-beat ghunnah** must be applied.

---

### 7. Meem Sakinah (مْ)
Similar structure to noon sakinah rules. Has three sub-rules:

- **Ikhfaa Shafawi** — meem hidden before ب
- **Idghaam Shafawi** — meem merges with following مـ
- **Idhaar Shafawi** — meem pronounced clearly before all other letters

---

### 8. Qalqalah (قَلْقَلَة) — Echo/Bouncing
An echo or bouncing sound applied to these five letters when they carry sukoon (سُكُون):

> ق  ط  ب  ج  د

Two levels:
- **Minor Qalqalah** — letter is in the middle of a word
- **Major Qalqalah** — letter is at the end of a word (stopped upon)

---

### 9. Al-Madd (المَدّ) — Elongation
Elongating specific letters based on context. The three madd letters are:

> ا  و  ي

Common types:

| Type | Description | Length |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Madd Asli (Natural) | No cause follows the madd letter | 2 beats |
| Madd Muttasil | Hamzah follows madd letter in same word | 4–5 beats |
| Madd Munfasil | Hamzah follows madd letter in next word | 4–5 beats |
| Madd Lazim | Sukoon or shaddah follows madd letter | 6 beats |

---

## Summary

| Rule | Core Concept |
|------|-------------|
| Idhaar | Pronounce clearly |
| Idghaam | Merge into next letter |
| Iqlaab | Convert noon to meem |
| Ikhfaa | Hide with nasalization |
| Mushaddad | Apply two-beat ghunnah |
| Meem Sakinah | Rules for silent meem |
| Qalqalah | Echo on 5 specific letters |
| Al-Madd | Elongate vowel letters |
