# 13 Waqaf Signs in the Quran You Need to Know

What is meant by waqaf signs in the Quran?

In this article, we will share with you several types of waqaf rules in the Quran and how to recite them correctly.

## Meaning of Waqaf

Linguistically, waqaf means to hold or to stop.

In technical terms, waqaf means to briefly pause the recitation of the Quran in order to breathe, with the intention of continuing the recitation afterwards.

Besides waqaf, there is also wasal. Wasal means to continue or connect the recitation.

If you are reciting the Quran and encounter a wasal sign, you may continue and connect with the following words.

## Types of Waqaf Signs in the Quran and Their Explanations

**1. Waqaf la washal (لا)**

The waqaf la washal sign means it is not permissible to stop at all. However, if this sign appears at the end of a verse, stopping is allowed.

An example of waqaf la washal can be found in Surah Al-Fatihah, verse 2.

**2. Waqaf lazim (م)**

Waqaf lazim, also known as waqaf tamm (the perfect stop), is a sign indicating whether a sentence is complete or not.

Waqaf lazim means it is obligatory to stop at the end of the sentence completely. An example is in Surah Al-An'am, verse 20.

**3. Waqaf murakhas (ص)**

When reciting the Quran and encountering the waqaf murakhas sign, it is preferable not to stop.

However, stopping is permitted in case of necessity, without changing the meaning or intent at all.

Examples can be found in Surah Al-Baqarah, verses 187 and 189.

**4. Waqaf al wasl ula (ﺻﻠﮯ)**

The ruling for a verse with waqaf al wasl ula is that it is preferred to continue the recitation.

However, you are also permitted to stop or continue. An example is in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 286.

**5. Waqaf mu'anaqah / muraqabah (∴……. ∴)**

The ruling for waqaf mu'anaqah, marked by three dots, is to stop at one of the two waqaf signs.

An example is in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 2.

**6. Waqaf jaiz (ج)**

The ruling for waqaf jaiz is that you may either stop or continue. An example of waqaf jaiz is in Surah Al-Qadar, verse 4.

**7. Waqaf waqfu aula (قلى)**

The ruling for waqaf waqfu aula means "stopping is preferred."

When a verse contains the waqaf waqfu aula sign, it is better to prioritise stopping at the word where this sign appears.

An example can be found in Surah Al-Mulk, verse 6.

**8. Waqaf mutlaq (ط)**

The ruling for waqaf mutlaq is that stopping is required. An example is in Surah Al-Mulk, verse 6.

**9. Waqaf saktah (سكتة)**

The ruling for waqaf saktah is to pause briefly without breathing.

When a waqaf saktah sign is present, one must pause briefly to break the recitation, but breathing is not permitted during this pause.

An example is in Surah Al-Mutaffifin, verse 14.

**10. Waqaf qila waqaf (ق)**

The ruling for waqaf qila waqaf is that continuing the recitation is preferred.

When this sign appears in a Quranic verse, it is better to continue the recitation.

**11. Waqaf muhawwaz (ز)**

The ruling for waqaf muhawwaz means continuing the recitation is preferred.

**12. Waqaf mustahab (قيف)**

The waqaf mustahab sign means stopping is preferred. When this sign is present, it is recommended to stop rather than continue.

An example is in Surah Al-Baqarah, verse 253.

**13. Waqaf kadzalik (ك)**

The waqaf kadzalik sign means it is the same as the previous waqaf. If you encounter this sign, you must apply the same rule as the waqaf before it.

## The Benefit of Waqaf Signs

With the presence of waqaf signs, it becomes easier for you to breathe without breaking the flow of the Quranic verse being recited.

They also make it progressively easier to recite the Quran properly and in an orderly manner.

It is hoped that this sharing on waqaf signs in the Quran provides useful information and knowledge to serve as a reference for all.
